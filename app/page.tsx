          Hey! I'm James, a software engineer based in the Bay Area.

        <p>
          Technology, to me, is akin to magic â€” it empowers us to solve impossible problems and
          convert dreams to reality. I'm on a mission to equip myself with the knowledge and skills
          needed to bring my creative visions to life, solve important real-world problems, and make
          meaningful contributions to my community. I'm driven by relentless curiosity and desire to
          understand our world, and by my passion for design, problem-solving, and building. I enjoy
          combining art, science, and engineering to create excellent products and services that are
          both functional and aesthetic.
